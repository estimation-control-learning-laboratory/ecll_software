# RCAC C for Arduino
RCAC implementation for output feedback control of a dynamic system

Run RCAC_linear_MP_runner.ino in Arduino IDE

RCAC_Scalar.ino is a sketch made by Alex Dorsey with the intentions of it being made into .cpp and .h files for easier deployment. It was checked against RCAC_V6.m in MATLAB and matches the output of RCAC
